G51h78s4gvvILhXSrBbT3w,fpiirm8MU_hSJBjHpbtIUA,CPFKi2lZJazP6IdtCdDDyg,4,2,1,4,"While I was sad to see Bibo close at this location, I've been a fan of Coffeebar in Truckee for a while, so was excited to hear of a Reno location.  It was curious that they didn't open faster (sat dormant for six months), but seeing the space now, it makes sense.
They've taken the whole western side of the building (not sure what was here before), and the space that was formerly Bibo appears to be dominated by a large kitchen now.  There's 3 or 4 four tops up front, and a large TV that was showing the Niners-Seahawks game.  Two large refrigerated cases in an L-shape, counter to order from, and then a gigantic espresso machine - cases and counter are probably a good 25 feet.  Back of the space has lots of tables, probably a half-dozen four tops as well as some counter top seating.  Exposed ceilings and ductwork - probably close to 14 feet, so the space looks big.  White subway tile behind the counter, orange pain on the non-brick walls, and a large bent stainless/LED light fixture in the back.  For those familiar with the former Bibo, this is a huge change, as the space is massive, and seems like it'll be a great spot to get some work done.  
Another big change from Bibo is that there's wireless internet (and plenty of tables and seating to camp out with a laptop).
I had a large Americano while I typed this up. 
Rad new location in the old Southwest that while I'm sure will have some holdouts due to all the drama around Bibo and the former location, seems like they've got enough good things going that they'll do all right.",2014-01-20 0:15:22,0.5,0.5

The coffee here is excellent, and the Barista always friendly.  I usually order the Tres Leche drink or cappuccino.  Both help when I need to get some serious studying done or walk the mall area.  While the drinks here tend to be more on the pricier side, I think of it as a treat.  A place to go when I'm too lazy to bring out my french press and make coffee for myself.

The scallion pancakes were a perfect appetizer. They came out hot, crispy, and a little oily, delicious.
The tonkatsu chicken and fried tofu bao were both delicious. All the condiments on their bao make for a sort of savory, sort of sweet flavor combo (cilantro, sweet sauce, and a few other things I don't remember off the top of my head)
The popcorn chicken was also excellent. Tiny, very crispy bits of chicken served with rice and a potato salad. I didn't try the potato salad, but heard it was more of a macaroni salad.

One of the reasons it is my favorite over other coffee options is because of their big food menus.  I'm not extremely picky about what kind of coffee I want or like so a lot of times I go to Coffeebar just to eat!  They have a great crepes and pastries and my favorite is the nutella/banana/strawberry crepe! 
One of the other reasons that I like Coffeebar so much is because they have a beautiful outdoor patio in the back with a gorgeous big wood table.  I love sitting out here in the summer! 
The only reason this is a 4 star review and not a 5 star review is because of the service.  Everyone who works there is nice but not often as helpful as I need them to be.  For example, last week I ordered a hot tea there for the first time and it came in a weird metal cylinder that took up the entire space of the mug.  I had no idea what it was so I picked it up and gave myself a steam burn.  I was able to go up to the counter again and ask how to use it but she said ""oh they really should have asked if you knew how to use it when you ordered!"" - I agree.

I came in with my sister for dinner tonight and since both of us have not been here before we asked for recommendations. Their top 3 classic bibimbap were the bulgogi beef, spicy pork and teriyaki chicken. My sister ordered the bulgogi and I ordered the teriyaki chicken. We were told that all bibimbap comes with miso soup which was nice. With yelp check-in, you get 50% off the second bowl. 
Let me just say that I love the location and the decor of the place. It's very aesthetic and modern. There are plenty of tables and bar like seating. Did I mention the staffs? Well the staffs are super friendly and helpful. 
The food is delicious with a few different kind of mixing sauce to choose from. My sister and I love spicy food so we both chose the Korean spicy sauce but we mixed in a little of the super spicy sauce because we wanted to feel more of a kick.

I try not to order the same dishes twice, but the food here is so good, I can't help but have a few favorites. The popcorn chicken must be included in every meals the light and crunchy coating is seasoned with some sweet warm spices that make the chicken delicious all on its own, but if you dip it in the sauce, it's next level. I also have a hard time skipping over dishes in the basil sauce, which usually is chicken, but this time I tried the king mushrooms. These are meaty and delicious, stir fried in a slightly sweet, spicy and savory sauce studded with whole cloves of garlic, big pieces of ginger and chili!

The Authentic Taiwanese section is always good for a few foodie thrills. This time around we tried the house style braised pork belly. I'd say this one was good, but I missed the sauce and braised veg I enjoy with other preparations.

My favorite section of the menu is the ""appetizers"". New items are always added here, and they're typically great. This time we went with the braised Napa cabbage (so savory, delicious, and full of umami) and the omelette with salty daikon. Both home runs. The sweetness of the egg mixed with seasoning and the salty pickled daikon was a great contrast to a lot of the richer dishes we ordered, and adding the leftovers to fried rice was amazing!

First of all, I had known this place for their baked goods, specifically their Macaroons.Being one of the few places in town that I know for sure had them. But I had no idea about the cafe, that they had here. 
I didn't want anything too heavy although they  had ordered the Pico De Gallo Eggs Benedict. and I'm glad I did. It came topped with avocado, and Haus-made salsa and hollandaise. The avocado was ripe, and super fresh.The salsa wasn't over overbearing in spice, but still came full in flavor which is what I was hoping for. They hit it right on the nail with the Benedict. I absolutely loved it.
It came with a side of cottage potatoes which were probably the best spuds Ive had to date. To my surprise, from the looks of the potatoes, I didn't think they'd be so delicious. I loved them.The texture...The Flavor...  Cooked with the skin on, the potatoes were crisp and well seasoned on the outside, and cooked so well that they melt in your mouth. Definitely will be one of my go to dishes.
I'll definitely be back
I Saw that they had a pot pie, on their menu. Im for sure gonna try that on my next visit.
Being that the place is a bakery, I for sure had to pick up some dessert on my way out. Grabbed a few Macaroons (Pistachio, Hazelnut, and Oreo Cookie) on the way out.",2018-02-08 14:52:34,1,0.8

stWqQQJk6h_PUCzaLuARBQ,-GowNe73gDZs9MfS3ugJDQ,FkRQ735Sh9JOsHBQYXFkEw,5,2,0,1,"New building means a new review!  For those of you who've been looking, Reno Coffee Company has relocated to a much expanded store on the corner of Wells and Vassar.  And while I'm sad to see the very lovely, quaint little store go, it is still always a good thing when a local business can grow.  The new building is a serious upgrade from the original location, which clears the way for such luxuries as tables and chairs and couches that let people sit and enjoy their coffee like an actual café.  But rest assured, the same quirky décor and aesthetics are here, and more importantly, so is the amazing coffee you've come to expect.

Here, every beverage is made to order.  Pick your bean variety, form their selection of about a dozen or so with different origins, roast levels, and flavor profiles, and watch as the staff grind up your individual portion, and use their nifty counter top setup to make an amazing cup of pour-over.  After that, you get to choose how you customize your drink, from the type of creamer, the type of sweetener, and additions of spices, in order to tailor it to just the way you like it.  In addition to the option to build your own cup, they also have a small menu of house specialty drinks you can enjoy, too.  The Morning Mojito is a popular choice, sweetened with agave nectar and mint leaves.  But I would highly recommend the Chocolate Pour, which is a most excellent mocha-esque drink.  There is also a fridge case with teas and kombucha, and should you come later in the afternoon or evening, you can also indulge in the recent additions to the menu of wine and beer, both on tap and in cans.  One thing you will not find on their menu, however, is espresso-drinks.  But honestly, you won't even miss your lattes and cappuccinos, as this place shows you just how good brewed coffee can be.  There is also, as of yet, no food options either, which is fine by me, as it makes this a literal ""coffee shop"" in that it is just a place to enjoy a quality beverage.

As prices go, we all know the old joke about paying a lot for ""JUST"" a cup of coffee.  However, that is actually sort of true here, as there are certainly no cheap drinks.  Expect to pay at least $4 for a cup, with prices going up from there depending on the size you get, or what beverage you choose.  However, before you let the sticker shock turn you off, I would say it is well worth the price for this phenomenal quality, and is comparable prices to most espresso drinks anyway.  Beer starts at around $6 per pint, and wine at about $8 per glass.  And you can take home a whole bag of their coffee, whole beans or ground, starting around $15 and up.

Service here is exceptionally friendly and courteous, and what really elevates them over a lot of other coffeehouses in this town.  As for speed, do not expect them to just pour you out a cup, as it takes a few minutes to properly brew up your individual orders.  I will say one of the very few drawbacks to this place is that this method can, at times, lead to a bit more of a wait if you stop by when a lot of people are in line ordering drinks.  But to me, it is well worth the wait.

The building itself is bright and open, with parking usually pretty easily obtained from various street spaces out front and around the corner, though be cautious if getting in and out of cars if you are parked along Wells itself.

All in all, Reno Coffee Company continues to prove why they are one of the absolute best places in town to get your caffeine fix.  It is certainly one of the more unique places to grab a cup-o-joe, and I will certainly continue to make them a regular stop.",2019-09-06 17:27:25,1,0.95

We arrived at 11am as soon as they opened. But she served us later than all the other tables of customers who arrived later than us. We told her that we're ready to order, but she still served people who speak Cantonese first, and asked us to just wait. 
When ordering, we asked her if she had any recommendations. She just said ""if you are not ready, order later."" Then she walked away. We were very disappointed at her attitude.
As soon as we finished our food, she immediately walked to us, and asked us to check. We were having lunch with a friend who we hadn't seen for a year, so we wanted to chat for a while. So we said ""maybe give us a few more minutes"" Then she said ""please leave immediately after finishing your lunch, because we still have people waiting outside."" Although all the other tables are still chatting. But we had to check immediately and leave. 
We feel that we are discriminated by her just because we don't speak Cantonese, although we can speak English and mandarin very well. I believe that all people should be served equally no matter which languages that can speak. And in US, a Taiwanese restaurant shouldn't discriminate people who can speak English or mandarin.
And again, all the other people there are friendly. And the foods are good. So I still think that you can try it if you can speak Cantonese or the woman with ponytail is not there.",2018-07-01 19:52:19,0.85,0.2

The service was generally slow, and the waitress kept forgetting one of our party's margaritas. 
The food was ok. I had the roasted eggplant sandwich, which was tasty but hard to eat. Another person had the shrimp salad- which came out with the saddest, tiniest shrimp. The salad also looked kind of dead- with wilted looking vegetables. And the people who ordered the burgers thought they were good. Is it a worthy $10 burger though, I'm not sure.

I reliably go here for bibimbap but unfortunately, this is happening. I've been here in person before and I loved the decor, miso soup, and selection of sauces. So I decided to order off UberEats. I don't know what happened but my meal was pretty subpar. 
When I order tofu bibimbap, I expect the carrots to be shredded. Instead, they just threw in 4 baby carrots in my dish. That's a little odd. Along with that, the broccoli and cauliflower were just not cooked at all. I could be mistaken but I think those are supposed to be steamed. Lastly, there was no egg, spinach, or cucumber. Those vegetables are advertised in the UberEats selection yet they are not there. This was extremely lackluster.
Not only that, but my friend, who ordered the japchae meal only got 1 baby carrot. If you do not have the proper ingredients, please list it somewhere. Make the menu item invalid. Just don't let me order it only for us to be disappointed.

First, I learned that Bab Cafe is owned by some experienced restaurant professionals. Jae runs the front of the house while JJ is in the kitchen. They're supported by an eager and passionate team of wonderful people who want to share their cuisine with you.
Their experience shows in everything at Bab Cafe, from the branded eco friendly sporks and bowls, to the design of the menu and restaurant, to the operation, service and overall guest experience. They are even so thoughtful to offer guidance on the amount of sauce they recommend for each menu item! It's all so well thought out and the final product is a great product and great guest experience. 
Today I also learned that Bab means rice.
Then I learned that Bibimbab means mixed rice! 
This whole time I'd thought Bibimbab was that Korean dish served in the hot clay pot with the crispy rice at the bottom! Turns out that's Torsol Bibimbab, a more formal version of the dishes they serve here!
Lastly I learned that Koreans don't consider it a meal if it doesn't have Bab aka rice! So while Bab Cafe is more than happy to accommodate all sorts of guest requests, including riceless bowls, they'd really request you try their bowls as they've designed them. 
Today we did just that, along with Korean style maki rolls (super tasty), japchae, house kimchi, and their Korean Fried Chicken Wings (Damn!!!) and I can't wait to go back!",2017-05-10 3:19:59,1,1

SVf6HThI6xJQWpu2UUUgjg,8VNmuYmFboXleIFf-stnFg,ytaVHTK7kdHxUscf2PCrow,5,7,1,5,"In many east Asian cultures, the craters and seas of the moon are interpreted as the image of a rabbit. Origin stories of this lunar leporid generally involve a theme of community, respect, and self-sacrifice. These allegorical traditions are the inspiration behind a once-a-month dinner served at the Moon Rabbit Cafe, a pay-what-you-can community effort staffed by volunteers at the Reno Buddhist Center (every third Saturday, 4pm-8pm).
Dining is done family style, with long tables of about 12 seats each and a total capacity of 80. We waited for roughly 30 minutes to be seated, and the staff tell me they served a record crowd of over 200 that evening. The aromas coming from the dining room were so enticing we didn't mind a bit on the wait, and the volunteer staff did a bang-up job keeping things friendly and feeling unrushed, all while moving folks through at a decent pace.
Each month a different theme is chosen, often with a guest chef creating the menu. April's theme was ""Ooh La La Paris in the Spring"", featuring some classic French dishes, each with a little twist showcasing the chef's creativity. First course was a canapé plate of crostini with toasted gruyere, a jam of caramelized onion and rosemary, garnished with fresh chives and chive blossoms. The appearance and flavor was akin to a deconstructed French onion soup, with a nice touch of garden freshness.
There were two entrées to choose from--one vegan, one not--both served with an arugula salad dressed in lemon and fennel seed vinaigrette. By itself the salad was a star on the plate, the peppery flavor of arugula pairing perfectly with the seasoned, slightly tart dressing. Layered ratatouille filled the vegan role, with green zucchini, yellow squash, and roma tomatoes. A thick, pureed sauce made from the vegetable ends, eggplant, red bell pepper, onion, lemon, rosemary, and oil perfectly bound it all together. Definitely one of the most flavorful squash-based dishes I've been served.
As if that wasn't enough, the chef's take on coq au vin started with chicken thighs marinated in pinot noir, seared in bacon fat, then braised in a blend of wine and housemade veggie stock. Combined with roasted red potatoes and turnips--and carrots sauteed in butter and cardamom--the resulting flavor profile was very well developed, subtle, and truly delicious.
Beverages included ice water, tea, coffee, and a spritzer that appeared to be a blend of concord grape juice and seltzer water. The spritzer didn't really work for me--reminding me of Kiddie Coolers my parents used to order for us tykes--but the coffee was quite good, very robust and a perfect pairing with dessert. Provided by a local bakery, dessert was a delicate little lemon and raspberry tartlet served a la mode. It featured a nice balance of tart and sweet, with a single whole raspberry right in the center. A perfect end to a great meal.
I found the pay-what-you-can concept a refreshing idea, allowing folks from all walks of life to enjoy a great meal together. Both while waiting to be seated and during the meal, it was hard not to connect and chat with perfect strangers enjoying the meal and the community vibe together. The next dinner is on May 21st, although the theme and chef are yet to be announced. The chef who prepared our delicious meal turns out to be a semi-amateur with a passion for cooking, and Moon Rabbit Cafe is seeking new chefs to create future dinners If you are or know someone with a similar drive to share your talents for a great cause, contact Shelly or Connie at 775-525-1182 or moonrabbit@renobuddhistcenter.org.",2016-05-15 22:55:16,1,1

There were several different breakfast sandwiches on the menu. We were looking for just a quick bit. Simple pastries, donuts etc. The place calls itself a bakery, so I assumed the croissants, pastries, and donuts would be very fresh. This was not the case. I had a ham & cheese croissant, which was ok, but not that fresh, flakey etc. My daughter ordered the ""seasonal donut"" which was $4.00. It was just an iced cake donut with colored sprinkles. Nothing more than you'd find at a cheap donut place for $1.00 or less. My wife had a blueberry danish. Again, it was OK, but not great. This place says it is a bakery. Am I wrong for assuming the baked goods would be fresh and better than average? If you're going to charge me $4.00 for a donut, it better be the best darn donut I ever ate.

The staff are amazing, before you order your drink they'll walk you through recommendations patiently figuring out what you're in the mood for. Currently I'm on a ""warm decaf drink without a lot of sugar"" kick so it's taking me a minute to order and the staff at Swill are ever so kind and helpful. Once you order and your drink is made they'll bring it to your table instead of calling you up. Simply pleasure, but ever-so-meaningful. If you order a pot of tea they'll check on it while you're there, make sure it isn't steeping too long, etc. Its these little things that make this place 100% for service. They also have smoothies and baked goods. I recently tried a slice of chocolate pumpkin loaf and it was exquisite. 

I'm yet to mention my favorite thing about this place. The tables! There is an adjunct room full of spacious collaboration tables and comfortable seating areas. Unlike typical coffee shops, it's away from the counter so it's quite enough to conduct business without grinders or other load coffee-making-noise that you have to talk over.

We sat and played with them, using the toys that were strewn about, and we even fed them with the treats that were provided.  Some of the cats were so active and entertaining, and very amusing.  A truly different kind of experience, and we wished that we could have taken one (or more) of the cats home with us.

The menu is widely ranged everything from Coffee and Tea , pastries , and lunch ideas. They even have a gelato bar.
My favorites to drink are always the Chai tea's , lavender latte , and their lattes in general but switch them out with coconut milk if you want to try something different. But overall I really enjoyed their different tea lattes.
The food is well thought out and there's always something different but you can always count on some staples as well. Their pastries are enjoyable , not necessarily the best out there but still really good. I have yet to have any of their gelato but it really does look yummy. Their sandwiches are very good as well.
The parking is decent. There is a small parking lot off to the side and then if that's full there's street parking but there's always plenty of spaces. Their hours are very reasonable as well being that they are open till about 9 p.m. or so in the evening.
Just a couple cons :
Definitely do not go at rush hour you will not have any place to sit or you'll be standing inside during winter hours to waiting for a place to sit. I would recommend to go either mid morning or later in the afternoon.
One thing I was highly disappointed in were there crepes , definitely not authentic at all.
Their prices are hit-and-miss for me. I don't mind paying extra for local places but I expect more from the food in general. The pricing on the drinks are very reasonable.",2016-04-08 7:44:18,0.85,0.75

I visited this place a handful of times when in town and the food that was always inconsistent was the rice and beans.  Of all things!  One time the rice was too cuminy.  Other times bland.  Other times just right.  What's going on?
I am addicted to their tostada.  I ask for rice on the tostada because it's only chicken and beans.  
Their cheese enchiladas have onion pieces in it and my husband orders it without.
The cheese enchilada is delicious.  It's simple but I say we like it a lot because of the good cheese they use.
I also love their beef tacos--they have potatoes mixed in.  And the shell is the home-fried poofy kind and not the generic taco shells.  
The downside is for their bowl of chips and salsa, their chips are always stale.  That's a huge disappointment.  But  I guess their salsa makes up for it because I use that for my food.  
Service also I have to say is a downside when there aren't a lot of people in there.  You'd think they'd give you better service but it was the exact opposite.

It's might even be pretty good, but when I'm coming up to visit I want something to really hit the spot. Cajun Kitchen just doesn't do it for me. I think I enjoyed this place waaayyyy more when I was still living in Goleta. Now I only get to visit a few times a year. I have so many places that I absolutely love in the Santa Barbara area that going here is pretty far down on my list.

With that said, the biscuits and the cornbread are both phenomenal. Both sides come with apple butter and butter. Those have always been great and are almost worth the wait to get a table. On my last trip here, the cornbread with apple butter were eyes rolling to the back of my head good. And then I went on to eat my California Benedict and was sad that I had started with the cornbread. It wasn't bad. It was okay. But it was like having such a strong start with such a weak finish. The hash browns are good but I wouldn't recommend the home fries. The jambalaya with eggs is decent but I think that's because I really like the eggs mixed in. 

The service here is also usually very good. They're usually really nice and very attentive. On my last visit, I think our server was just having a bad day and he seemed like he really didn't want to be there. 

Overall if you live in the area and want to get brunch then go for it. If you have friends visiting, go ahead and toss it up as a possible place for brunch.

They also have the display case with several sandwiches with Italian names. I haven't tried too many of these because they look really big. They apparently import some stuff from Wild Garlic next door, like their calzones.
But my favourite food item here is the veggie frittata. Best frittata ever, and  perfect for a light lunch. This place is almost always crowded, but I've never had a problem finding seating or parking. I do feel sorry for the nearby residents though, as they get a lot of Coffeebar customers parking in front of their house.
Lastly, and I noticed this with their Truckee location too, they use dry noodles as stir sticks, which I think is a great idea- not only are they biodegradable, but edible too! I like to dunk mine in my coffee and nibble on it (though I don't recommend this for people with sensitive teeth).",2014-11-02 20:57:58,0.9,0.85

After that experience I felt like I needed a beer or a glass of wine, which they serve there too! 

But that aside, Swill is a great place to hang. They have the most workspace of any coffee shop in town, making them a great spot to meet with friends, a small organization, or even host an event.

Jia Jiang Mien was okay, again a little on the salty side and noodles were almost stale-tasting. Generous portion but can still make better at home.

Dutch Baby: 3/5
Service: friendly but VERY SLOW for breakfast food. I get that it's made to order, but breakfast really shouldn't take more that 30 minutes, unless they're making biscuits and preserves from scratch upon ordering. If that's the case, then kudos.
They also do NOT have fresh squeezed OJ. I feel that's a must for a breakfast joint.

But come on, we're in SANTA BARBARA guys, so cut these people some slack. The most authentic Pho you can find in the states would be located in California cities of Garden Grove, Westminster, or San Jose. The cooks are Vietnamese, so it made me feel sort of at home when I hear them talk in Vietnamese in the kitchen. I felt pretty alone in Santa Barbara due to the lack of people from Vietnam, until I came here. 
 
Now about the food, it's quite delicious! HUGE drink selection! I definitely recommend the taro, mixed berry, marcha, or banana smoothie! But honestly....all of the smoothies are amazing. If you upgrade to a milkshake it comes with ice cream!! I had the Combination Pho and it was pretty decent! $10 is what's expected in Isla Vista...taking in consideration the owner has to go a long way to get the necessary resources since Santa Barbara literally has no good asian market. The bowl was filling. However, if you want to order a large, go for it! That portion is amazingly generous!!  ***For all you chili lovers, ask for chili paste to go with your soup!!*** trust me it makes a huge difference.
Also, the cups they use for water is so VIETNAMESE it made so happy lol!

I have had lunch there a few times when I worked on that side of town but I am a sucker for a tasty breakfast.  We  grab a table and usually it takes a little bit to even be acknowledge by the waitress but if you know that is what to expect then fine.  European dining can be like that, in some places when you go to dinner you could have that table all night.  I think they may follow that mindset.  It can be annoying if you are hungry or you want to get in and out of there quickly.  But I digress back to the food.  They have a pretty good sized breakfast menu that they serve until 3pm.  They even have a few healthy options.  There is usually four of us and this time was no different.  We all usually take a bite off each other's plate as I don't think I have had a dish there I don't like.  We got the green benedict,  Denver omelette, corned beef and hash,  and the crepes with strawberries and French cream.  I have also had the waffles and the scrambles there and those are usually made very well.  The green benedict is one of my favorite things that they serve.  The spinach is creamy and the sauce has the perfect amount of tang to it.  They do a very good poached egg there.  I am not usually a poached or fried egg person because I am not a fan of the yolk but for the green benedict it all works so well I have no problem with eating it.  The Denver omelette has good flavor and has a good ratio of ingredients, ham, peppers, cheese, and onions.  It normally comes with hollandaise sauce on it but you can have it without.  It is also one of the items that can be made heart healthy.  The corned beef is good I like to order it because it is tasty and it fills you up.  I usually get the eggs scrambled and they are always light and fluffy.  The crepes are one of the best things they do there.  These were up to the task.  They had a good strawberry flavor and the cream was airy and smooth.  They had that melt in your mouth quality that just put them over the top.  The potatoes that come with most of the breakfasts are like home fries.  Good but don't eat too much of them because you will fill up quickly.  Some of the dishes on the menu, I think the scrambles and omelettes come with a small danish as well as all of the other things that come on the plate.  It is a nice little surprise  for your meal.  We always get a latte and those are pretty decent and one server makes it better than the others but it isn't bad,  The coffees go well with the breakfast.  When we did lunch my favorite thing to get was the lunch special for that curried chicken salad.  If you have not had it you must get it.  Sometimes I have had soup there that I have to add pepper to to give it an oomph of flavor.  but hey they can't be good at everything.  They do have great pastries I like to order out of the case.  I wouldn't recommend a special order.  It can be pricey and sometimes the job isn't well done.

They are very generous with their fresh fruit, peanut butter, coconut and granola toppings. Some toppings are limited to their seasonal availability. 
I've been coming here for years but generally as a special occasion treat as they are so pricey and full of sugar. I've had everything from the Acai Oatmeal to the Green Bowl. The Hercules is my go-to smoothie here, but again very sugary and not the healthiest protein shake. It's made with hemp milk which gives it the perfect texture and thickness but is often very heavy.

I had a ""Carne Asada"" burrito and it tasted absolutely atrocious. They put a can of refried beans that weren't even heated all the way. They used burnt niblets of mystery meat to maybe ""save"" money and cut corners. I would say Chipotle is more authentic than this place but even that's giving them too much credit. Taco Bell is a better comparison with the slight edge to TBL. DO NOT GO HERE, but hey at least your meal comes with a few free chips.",2018-11-09 7:18:14,0.1,0.5

It's atmosphere is eclectic: soothing and energizing at the same time. Plus, their menu provides an array of options for the all levels of coffee connoisseurs that come from locally-provided ingredients and well-treated farm animals. I enjoyed two of their mocha cappuccinos and their frittatas. The cappuccinos were beautiful, warming, and delicious. The frittatas were a little dry, but still satisfying. I recommend this place as a meeting place for a light brunch, to catch up with friends, or to entrench yourself in your recent favorite read, but prepared to be there for a couple hours.

But then I put it back down to two when I found out that the kids meal was actually nine dollars because they gave us a three dollar up charge for changing the fries to fruit. They also did this to my mother-in-law. So we paid nine dollars for that kids meal....
Mixed feelings. The Wienerschnitzel is good but I wouldn't order anything else because the portions are just ridiculously small (besides the Wienerschnitzel) it was $6 for my daughters kids-meal. We ordered her a grilled cheese. They literally served her half of a grilled cheese that was cooked on really small bread so really it was more like half of a half of a grilled cheese.... not really willing to help you if you're unhappy. I really enjoy the atmosphere and getting coffee here so I'm very conflicted. Good pastries.

I must begin by saying that I love Cafe DeLuxe for multiple reasons. First, it is a great place to work. They have free wi-fi and I can sit either outside if it is nice or inside the adorable restaurant. 

Second, I love how fresh all the products are they use for their food and how they have some many healthy options! It just makes the food taste that much better. The variety is awesome! I have had multiple meals at Cafe DeLuxe and think the frittata with its potato crust and the homefries are amazing! Definitely a must try if you are going for the first time. The home made chai and smoothies are also good choices to check out!

My husband also really enjoys Cafe DeLuxe which makes it a great place to bring the family. As I mentioned previously they have wi-fi which makes it a popular place for me and my colleagues to be able to get some work done while having some great food. Some of our best work has came out of that place!

Keep up the amazing establishment you have going Cafe DeLuxe!",2015-09-30 19:43:01,0.9,0.9

When you try to kill me off with chicken bones like some kind of voodoo shaman I will fight back with Taiwanese stars (removal) :)  
Really though, aside from the chicken being deadly sharp, it had great flavor. I'm sure the other less-deadly dishes are tasty as well. Also, the boba was great and while we were there more than a few people seemed to be coming in just for that.",2016-08-22 17:23:46,0.7,0.7

All the gummy toppings were hard as rocks and it was generally a very unpleasant eating experience. If I were to go again, I would stick to chocolates and nuts. But I doubt that will happen. The kids working there were not very personable. The only thing they said to us the whole time was the price of our frozen yogurt when we finally went up to purchase them.
